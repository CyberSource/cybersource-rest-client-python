Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, the following terms shall apply with respect to Customer's participation in any Beta Evaluation (and the Beta Product(s)) accessed thereunder): The Parties will enter into a separate form agreement detailing the scope of the Beta Evaluation, requirements, pricing, the length of the beta evaluation period ("Beta Product Form").

Cybersource may, in its sole discretion, at any time, terminate or discontinue the Beta Evaluation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that any Beta Product may still be in development and that Beta Product is provided "AS IS" and may not perform at the level of a commercially available service, may not operate as expected and may be modified prior to release.
